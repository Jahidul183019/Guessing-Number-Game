# Guessing Number Game

A simple Java project — my first attempt at creating a Guessing Number Game.  
This project is designed to practice Java programming, problem-solving, and logic-building skills.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

- The computer randomly selects a number within a specified range.
- The player tries to guess the number.
- After each guess, the game tells whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The game continues until the player guesses correctly.
- It tracks the number of attempts and gives feedback.
